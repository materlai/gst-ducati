WHAT IT IS
----------

gst-ducati is a plugin for using the hw accellerated codecs on IVA-HD via the
codec-engine API.  Uses the libdce (distributed codec-engine) library to
use the codec on ducati.

WHY IS IT?
----------

An OpenMAX-like API is provided by TI along with modified gst-openmax
plugins.  So gst-ducati is not needed in that sense.  But libdce and this
was an interesting project for me to try on my free time.

TO BUILD:
---------

Install normal gstreamer and gst-plugins-base dev packages (or build them
yourself so you have the headers, etc).  Then install the corresponding
syslink/tiler/d2c packages (matching your kernel version).  And finally
libdce (https://github.com/robclark/libdce) matching your kernel version.

TODO
----
+ handle h264 avc format (in addition to just bytestream)
+ mjpeg
+ encoding
